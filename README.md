# DIY Portable Air Purifier Designs

Laser cutting designs for DIY portable air purifiers with 1 or 2 fans inspired by the [Clean Air Kit Exhalaron](https://www.cleanairkits.com/products/exhalaron).

You might also want to check out the [3D printing files for air straighteners](https://github.com/chrisjensen/air-straightener/tree/main) to mount on these so that they create a nice strong wall of straight flowing air.

## üòÖ New to this? Don't worry!

Laser Cutting, 3D printing, oh my!

If this is your first time, a lot of these details can seem overwhelming, but don't worry, if you're not following the instructions below, you can probably provide the files as is to a laser cutter, along with an explanation of what you need, and (maybe for a small fee), they'll make any adjustments needed to your files for you to get the results you need.

I've always found people in Maker Spaces to be friendly and helpful provided you're polite üòä

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Quickstart

1. Choose your materials and thickness.

The design files are designed for 6mm materials. I've used Bamboo, Ply and MDF, you could also try Acrylic.

MDF is usually the cheapest and will do just fine.

You'll need to find someone with a laser cutter that can cut some materials for you. I've used wood or MDF for these, but you could also try acrylic.

In New Zealand I use [Make Shop](https://www.makeshop.co.nz/) for my laser cutting, and in Australia I use [The Laser Co](https://thelaserco.com/). Whoever you use will have their own requirements for how you provide files to them and you may need to adjust the files accordingly.

The choose if you're making a [double barrel](./double-fan/) or [single barrel](./single-fan) and follow the instructions in those folders.
