# DIY Portable Air Purifier Designs

Laser cutting designs for DIY portable air purifiers with 1 or 2 fans.

The designs also make use of the [3D printing files for air straighteners](https://github.com/chrisjensen/air-straightener/tree/main) to mount on these so that they create a nice strong wall of straight flowing air.

## ðŸ˜… New to this? Don't worry! You've got this ðŸ™Œ

_Laser Cutting, 3D printing, electrics? oh my!_

If you can build an IKEA bookshelf or chair, you can do this.

You don't even need a screwdriver, it can all be assembled by hand!

There's detailed instructions on the next page with pictures you can follow.

## ðŸ”¨ Finding a Maker Space

To get your materials cut to shape, you'll need to find a maker space and send them the designs I've included.

In New Zealand I use [Make Shop](https://www.makeshop.co.nz/) for my laser cutting, and in Australia I use [The Laser Co](https://thelaserco.com/). Whoever you use will have their own requirements for how you provide files to them and you may need to adjust the files accordingly.

Both of these places will have MDF on hand, and can cut and post it directly to you.

Now choose if you're making a [double fan](./double-fan/) or [single fan](./single-fan) design  follow the instructions in those folders.
