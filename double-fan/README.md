# Double Fan Portable Air Purifier

## Cost

Some of the main components (the fans, the filters) are not commonly sold in Aotearoa, and so are costly to obtain and import. You may be able to build this cheaper in Australia or the US.

The cost of the below components comes to around NZD $330.

If you, or someone you know, has the tools and knowhow to put 116mm holes into wood, you could save another $70 by sourcing and cutting the wood yourself and keeping the wood sections to two simple pieces of wood to sandwich the filters.

## Components

I've provided links to an AliExpress where you can find many of these components cheaply. Sellers and products change frequently so I can't link directly to a specific product so you'll have to search. The searching will show up some that aren't relevant, so do check that the product description matches closely the size and type required and when in doubt use the pictures as a reference.

| [7mm Air Straightener](https://github.com/chrisjensen/air-straightener/tree/main)          | An air straightener (or louvre) removes turbulence fro the air coming out of the fan, which means it will blow faster and further, helping to create a wall of air effect.

## Cutting & 3D Printing

I've used Bamboo, Ply and MDF, you could also try Acrylic.

MDF is usually the cheapest and will do just fine.

The cuts and the instructions are designed for 6mm thick materials. (I tried one with 3mm, but it bowed and didn't hold the filters in place well and I needed to add two more threaded rods in the middle to hold it together)

The materials will need to be laser cut or CNC cut, which you can get done at a Maker Space near you. Many will do the cutting and post the materials to you. See [main page](../)) for suggestions for places that can do the cutting in Aotearoa and Australia.

Once you've found a maker space or similar that can do laser cutting for you, you'll want to download the design files for the top, middle and bottom sections. 

If you provide them the files as is and the following instructions, they should know what to do with it:

Download the following 4 files for the laser cutting and 3D printing

| [Air Striaghtener 3D Print Design](https://github.com/chrisjensen/air-straightener/blob/main/%207mm%20x%20120mm%20air%20straightener.stl) |

If you're not sure what to provide to them, provide the designs with text to describe the engraving and they should be able to take it from there:

If you'd like to edit the designs, you can use [this source design file](../source%20design%20files/double%20portable%20-%20all%20layers.svg) which contains the design for all 3 pieces of wood in separate layers.

## Steps

1. Place the M4 bolts through the middle section of wood so that the head of the screw is recessed a little in the engraving.

![IMG_20240815_213516197_AE](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04e35988-2f73-494c-87a5-1b6fe0a61421)

2. Place the Mobius Fans on top with the wires facing into the middle section.
3. Connect the fan power wires to the DC 5.5 12V to dual PWM fan cable. (The fans also have cables for the lights, these will be loose and not connected to anything)

![IMG_20240815_213621132_AE](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c5c3a8a-20ba-4ee1-aa62-e43319b8b7e2)

4. Plug in the USB-C 12V adaptor to the DC socket to check that the fans turn and the air blows the correct direction before you proceed (the air should be flowing out the top of the fans).
  
5. Insert the two jigsaw pieces into the wooden slots and contain the wires within, place the DC socket outside and use the curved hole for the wire.

6. Screw the handle into the top panel. Make sure it's screwed in firmly.
7. Place the top panel over the fans

![IMG_20240815_214704081_AE](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/859d9239-0ba8-49e3-babe-2a2321640485)

8. Place the air straighteners on the top panel over the fans, and screw hex caps on the end of the bolts to hold it together.

9. Take the threaded rods and screw a hex nut on one end, followed by the flat head end caps.

![20250106_075435](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8911457-5fe8-42ac-9afe-8eb0d44794e7)

11. Thread the rubber feet down the threaded rods to sit on the hex nuts.

![20250106_075514](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b4c12e3-2473-4792-8849-dd2b1e878618)

12. Tie elastic around the bottom panel. This can be used to hold a battery pack in place, so you'll want it quite tight so that it's held firmly against the panel even though it's heavy.

![20250106_073806](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d62ea414-c459-449b-a236-12be8a59b857)

13. Thread the rods through the bottom panel with the feet underneath and the engraved circles facing up.

![20250106_075607](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a014e44f-2c84-4662-9b0d-0a7470fb6d8b)

14. Place the filters on top of the engraved circles.

15. Place the assembled top section with the fans on top of the filters.

16. Screw the top section in place with the hex nuts and then with the hex caps. Make sure you hold the rod in place while you tighten the nuts and caps, otherwise it may turn and loosen the caps holding the rubber feet in place.

    There may be a gap between the nuts and caps, that's fine as long as the filters are held firmly in place. If it bothers you asthetically, you could add another hex nut in between.

17. Turn it on!
